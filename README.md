Conway's Game of Life

Rules are based on the number of live neighbors a cell has, affecting whether the cell lives, dies, or is born. A live cell dies from underpopulation (fewer than two live neighbors) or overcrowding (more than three live neighbors). A dead cell becomes a live cell if it has exactly three live neighbors. A live cell survives if it has two or three live neighbors.

Controls:
- Mouse Button 1 turns a dead cell into a living cell.
- Mouse Button 2 turns a live cell into a dead cell.
- [R] randomizes cells
- [S] start
- [P] pause
